# redis Cookbook
This cookbook will install Redis Server. At this time this cookbook only supports Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.

## Requirements
### Platforms
- Ubuntu 14.04
- Ubuntu 16.04

### Chef
- Chef '>= 12.5'

### Cookbooks
- apt

## Attributes
TBD

## Usage
Here's an example `redis` role that will install Redis.

```ruby
name 'redis'
description 'install redis'
override_attributes(
  'redis' => {
    ...
  }
)
run_list(
  'recipe[cop_redis::default]'
)
```

## Testing
* http://kitchen.ci
* http://serverspec.org

Testing is handled with ServerSpec, via Test Kitchen, which uses Docker to spin up VMs.

ServerSpec and Test Kitchen are bundled in the ChefDK package.

### Dependencies
```bash
$ brew cask install chefdk
$ chef gem install kitchen-docker
$ brew install docker docker-machine
$ docker-machine create default --driver virtualbox
```

### Running
Get a listing of your instances with:

```bash
$ kitchen list
```

Run Chef on an instance, in this case default-ubuntu-1204, with:

```bash
$ kitchen converge default-ubuntu-1204
```

Destroy all instances with:

```bash
$ kitchen destroy
```

Run through and test all the instances in serial by running:

```bash
$ kitchen test
```

## Notes
* The `Berksfile.lock` file has been purposely omitted, as we don't care about upstream dependencies.
